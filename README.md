# Online Course Management
Certainly! Let's outline the requirements and technologies for an "Online Course Management System" using Java 11, Spring framework, ORM for database integration, and following a 3-tier client-server architecture.

### Project Idea: Online Course Management System

**Overview:**
Create an Online Course Management System using Java 11, Spring Boot, Hibernate (as the ORM tool), and MySQL (or another relational database of your choice). This system will facilitate the management of courses, instructors, students, and enrollment.

**Features to Implement:**

1. **Client (Presentation Layer):**
   - Develop a web interface using Thymeleaf templates or a frontend framework (like Angular or React, if time permits).
   - Implement functionalities such as:
     - Displaying a list of courses with details (title, instructor, description, etc.).
     - Searching courses by title or instructor.
     - Enrolling students in courses.
     - Viewing enrolled courses and their details.

2. **Server (Business Logic Layer):**
   - Use Spring Boot to build RESTful APIs for:
     - CRUD operations for managing courses, instructors, and students.
     - Enrolling students in courses and managing course enrollment.
     - Authentication and authorization (basic authentication or JWT tokens).
     - Business logic for course enrollment limits, prerequisites (if any), etc.

3. **Database (Data Access Layer):**
   - Set up MySQL database (or any other relational database) to store:
     - Course information (title, instructor, description, etc.).
     - Instructor information (name, contact details, etc.).
     - Student information (name, email, etc.).
     - Enrollment information (which student is enrolled in which course).

4. **ORM Integration:**
   - Use Hibernate ORM for mapping Java objects to database tables.
   - Define entities such as `Course`, `Instructor`, `Student`, and `Enrollment`.
   - Implement DAO (Data Access Object) classes for CRUD operations using Spring Data JPA.

5. **Additional Considerations:**
   - Exception handling across layers.
   - Logging (using SLF4J and Logback).
   - Unit testing of service layer using JUnit and Mockito.
   - Deployment considerations (optional): Deploy on a cloud platform (like AWS or Heroku).

### Technologies Used:

- **Java 11:** Latest Java version with improved features and performance enhancements.
- **Spring Boot:** Simplifies the setup and development of Spring-based applications.
- **Hibernate:** Object-relational mapping framework for working with databases.
- **MySQL:** Relational database management system.
- **Spring Data JPA:** Simplifies data access with ORM frameworks.
- **Thymeleaf:** Server-side Java template engine for web and standalone environments.
- **JUnit & Mockito:** Testing frameworks for unit and mock testing.

### Project Structure:

- **Backend:**
  - Controller classes for handling HTTP requests.
  - Service classes for business logic.
  - Repository interfaces extending `JpaRepository` for data access.
  - Configuration files (application.properties/yml) for database connection.

- **Frontend (optional):**
  - Thymeleaf templates (HTML with embedded Thymeleaf expressions).
  - CSS for basic styling.
  - JavaScript (if using frontend frameworks like Angular or React).

### Expected Outcome:

By the end of the week, you should have a functional Online Course Management System demonstrating:
- CRUD operations using RESTful APIs.
- Database persistence using Hibernate.
- Basic user interface for interacting with the course management system (listing courses, enrolling students, etc.).
- Integration of Spring Boot components and libraries.

This project will showcase your proficiency in Java development, Spring framework, ORM integration, and database handling, which are essential skills for building scalable and maintainable applications. It can serve as a significant addition to your resume, demonstrating real-world application development experience.
